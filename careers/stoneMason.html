		<p>Stone masonry was the practice of building structures out of stone. The first masons used mud and clay, in the early Egyptian periods from about 2600-2500 BCE. Building with stone began in Ancient Greece. Masons created important historical monuments like pyramids and temples for gods and goddesses. Stone was shaped and smoothed by masons using stone-hammers. Images were also carved onto stone, some of which are preserved in today’s modern times. Examples of famous monuments built by masons include the temple of Ramses II and Menkaure’s pyramid. Both of these monuments were constructed out of granite, which was one of the most common mediums masons worked with. </p>

	<div id="benefits">
		<p>Stone masons were highly respected because they built some of the most important structures in history. Imagine being one of the people who helped create temples that are still being visited today! The salary was also incredibly high compared to most other jobs at the time. A stone mason earned double the salary of a general laborer job (for example: a shepherd). </p>

	<div id="education">
		<p>Stone masons needed to have experience in the field. It was necessary for hopeful masons to take on an apprenticeship with an older, more experienced mason and learn about design and construction. These apprenticeships could last months or even several years. </p>

	<div id="keySkills">
		<p><b>Strength</b>: You needed to be physically fit to be a stone mason. The job required lots of lifting of stone and other heavy materials, and you were constantly moving at a quick rate. Masonry was not for the weak of heart! </p>
		<p><b>Precision</b>: Stone masons could not make mistakes. A miscalculation or a bad move could result in a flawed structure. You needed to be sure that all measurements were correct before continuing your job.</p>
