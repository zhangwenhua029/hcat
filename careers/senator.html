		<p>The Roman Republic was run by the Senate. Senators were Patricians (aristocratic family members) or wealthy landowners who directed spending, oversaw tax collection, approved and disproved laws generated in the Assembly (a group that was elected by Romans from the Plebian class), and made decisions regarding foreign relations. They also advised the two Consuls, who represented the head of the Senate and were elected by a majority of the popular vote from all Roman citizens. Among other things, the Consuls originally selected senators for a life term and were responsible for replacing senators when they died.</p>
		<p>The Senate was established as an advisory committee to the consuls after the Roman monarchy was abolished in 509 BC. Consuls rarely disregarded the advice of the Senate, partially because they usually served as Senators after serving their 1 year term as consuls. There were usually around 300-600 senators. However, after the Roman civil war from 49-45 BC, Caesar increased that number to around 900, most of whom were his own supporters. In fact, few senators that opposed Caesar even survived!</p>

		<p>Among other things, senators had reserved seating at the Roman orchestra (a part of the theatre). They also had a great deal of power. Senators could: determine whether a new god could be introduced into the religion, distribute public money as they pleased, nominate ambassadors, respond to foreign ambassadors, decree public thanksgivings for victory, declare enemies of the state by voting, interpret laws, grant pardons, and punish and put-to-death those who they pleased in times of civil dissension.</p>
