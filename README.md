HCAT: A Historical Career Aptitude Test for the Royal Ontario Museum
====================================================================

This is like a career aptitude test, but instead of suggesting modern careers (like software engineers or lawyers), it suggests what kind of career you might have had 2000 years ago. It was designed as an educational tool for the ROM. Uses Ajax and jQuery wherever possible.
