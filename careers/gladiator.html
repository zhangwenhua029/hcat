		<p>Gladiators were the main attraction in Roman arenas. They were trained slaves, prisoners, and volunteers who fought each other, and animals, like tigers and lions. Gladiators had several fighting styles. For example, cataphractarius gladiators used heavy armor and swords, while dimachaeri gladiators fought with minimal armor so that they could move quickly. Another type of fighter, called a retiarius, even used a net and trident to fight!</p>
		<p>Gladiator fights were usually to the death—but when one was about to lose, he could ask for mercy. The crowd or leaders in the arena would decide his fate. Talk about wanting to get on someone’s good side!</p>
		<p>The first gladiator fights were organized by Decimus Brutus in 263 B.C., to honor his father’s death. Eventually gladiator fighting became well-established. By Julius Caesar’s time, most gladiators were slaves who had received special training, nutrition, and medical attention. Gladiators were revered as brave heroes.</p>

	<div id="salaryExpectations">
		<p>Gladiators who volunteered often did so to receive the down-payment that was provided after taking the gladiatorial oath. Professional gladiators (i.e. those who were neither criminals nor slaves) were also paid each time they fought. A new gladiator could make 3 times the salary of the average Roman, and veteran stars could make 12 times the salary of the average Roman! The winner of a battle would receive a prize, such as a golden bowl, crown or coin.</p>
		<p>For a gladiator who died in the arena, their lanista might charge the event sponsor (usually a wealthy aristocrat) up to 100 times the value of the surviving gladiator. As a result, the bloodshed that crowds loved was often costly for sponsors.</p>

	<div id="benefits">
		<p>Gladiators were seen as the embodiment of Roman courage and discipline. The benefits and importance of becoming a successful gladiator were: the possibility of fame, fortune, and a lavish lifestyle, acceptance as a courageous member of the gladiator group, known for good morale, courage and absolute loyalty, honor similar to that given to the Roman army, and the chance to get trained in the use of weapons.</p>
		<p>Some Romans also became gladiators to avoid mandatory military service—gladiators were freed after 5 years of combat rather than the 25 years that were required of a Roman soldier. Criminals who had committed non-capital crimes could earn their freedom if they survived 3-5 years of combat.</p>
		<p>And modern research suggests that gladiators actually had an 80-90% chance of surviving a battle at the arena—which is much higher than most people think.</p>

	<div id="education">
		<p>There were more than 100 gladiator schools throughout the Roman Empire. The schools were initially owned by private citizens, but later taken over by the state to prevent the build-up of a private army. The schools were controlled by a manager (lanista) who recruited, arranged for training and decided where and when the gladiators fought. New recruits were assessed by the lanista, a doctor (medici), and the gladiator’s trainers (doctores). Doctores were usually retired gladiators who specialized in certain types of fighting—doctores who trained retiarius gladiators were called Doctores Retiarii.</p>
		<p>Gladiators trained much like professional athletes do today. For initial training, gladiators used wooden training swords called a rudus, which were often double the weight of the original weapon, to build up the gladiator’s body and arm strength. They used the swords on a wooden pole called a palus, Gladiators had to learn physical combat, but they also had to learn how to die. Spectators expected gladiators to die bravely and with honor.</p>

	<div id="keySkills">
		<p><b>Combat skill</b>: Obviously, more skilled gladiators won more battles, survived often, and/or profited from the profession.</p>
		<p><b>Courage</b>: Gladiators were seen as the embodiment of Roman courage and discipline. They were treated much like professional athletes are today.</p>
		<p><b>Discipline</b>: Gladiator training schools were disciplined environments that strictly regulated the recruit’s diet, training and mental state. A gladiator was an expensive investment for a lanista, and as a result, they expected their charges to train as hard as possible and stick to the training regimen.</p>
