		<p>In Ancient Rome, “centurion” meant “captain of 100.” The Roman centurion was captain of 100 soldiers or more in a legion. A centurion began as a regular soldier in the army and slowly worked his way up the ranks by exhibiting strong loyalty and bravery. They were noticed by the general for their skills and courage in battle, and by exemplifying these traits they were able to become leaders of soldier troops. Centurions were the backbone of the entire Roman army. They wore a special helmet and harness which separated them from regular soldiers in an army. A typical legion had roughly 6,000 soldiers and centurions commanded 100 men each. Therefore there were 60 centurions per legion. The ordinary duties of the centurion were to drill his men, inspect their arms, food and clothing, and to command them in the camp and in the field. Becoming a centurion was a great honor amongst Romans and also came with a highly desirable salary. A famous centurion in Ancient Rome was Saint Agathius, who died in 303. Saint Agathius was arrested and eventually beheaded! He became a martyr because he refused to give up his Christian faith, which was forbidden at the time.</p>

		<p>The centurion received an annual salary that was approximately 20 times what ordinary soldiers received. Centurions earned about 5,000 denarii per year. A denarius (plural denarii) was an ancient Roman coin, made from silver, that was used as Roman currency from 211 BC to 270 AD. An ordinary soldier would receive only 200-300 denarii per year. There were five senior centurions in a legion who received 10,000 denarii per year. The chief centurion received 20,000 denarii in pay annually.</p>

		<p>Being a centurion was an incredible honor in Ancient Rome. It meant that you were the highest in your field and had been chosen specifically for the courage and leadership skills you showed while on the battle field. You also had the opportunity to move up even further in your ranks, with the possibility of becoming a senior or chief centurion. Centurions also received a significant salary which could be used to support families at home. </p>

		<p>Senators were just legionaries that displayed loyalty, bravery and a capacity to lead. As a result, their original training was identical to that of a Roman legionary, which is as follows:</p>
		<p>Roman legionaries were first taught to march, and to march quickly! During the summer, soldiers were expected to march 20 miles in 5 hours as part of their basic training. A disjointed army with stragglers was vulnerable to attack, and the Roman’s wanted to avoid this at all costs. Soldiers were also required to run, swim, and carry heavy packs.</p>
		<P>After basic conditioning, soldiers were trained to use weapons. They used wicker shields and wooden swords, which were each twice as heavy as regular weapons, so that they would be twice as effective in combat (just like a batting donut). First the soldiers trained on heavy wooden stakes, and then on each other. In the more advanced stage of training, called armatura, the weapons were of similar weight to the original ones. Finally, soldiers were trained to master the spear (called a pilum) which, in practice, was also twice as heavy as the original.</P>

	<div id="keySkills">
		<p>There were a few necessary factors needed in order to become a centurion. They had to be literate, have letters of recommendation, be at least 30 years old, and must have served for a few years in the military already. Centurions were chosen for their size, strength, and dexterity on the battle field. They also needed to be highly competent using swords and shields. Centurions needed to be vigilant, active, and ready to execute orders quickly and efficiently. Centurions also needed to keep up proper discipline amongst soldiers by keeping them clean and well-dressed.</p>
