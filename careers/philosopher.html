		<p>A specific education path was not required to become a philosopher. Greeks who were interested in the field would study under the guide of older philosophers. Many philosophers created their own schools around Greece to teach students various beliefs, such as the Peripatetic School in Athens. This school was founded by Aristotle, and the name “peripatetic” was given to his followers. The school began in 335 BC. The Peripatetic School, as well as most other schools of philosophy at the time, was an informal institution for students to ask philosophical and scientific questions. Two students at this school, Theophrastus and Strato, eventually ended up becoming Aristotle’s successors.  </p>
