		<p>Roman legionaries were professional soldiers in the Roman army. They had to be Roman citizens under the age of 45, and enlist in a legion for 25 years of service, the last 5 of which were spent on lighter duties. A legion was simply a unit in the Roman army consisting of approximately 5,400 soldiers. There were 2 main types of legionaries: milites (equivalent to today’s privates), and immunes, who were milites that were also trained as engineers, carpenters, and medics. Centurions were in charge of about 80 legionaries.</p>
		<p>While marching, the legionary would be loaded down with armour, a shield, a helmet, two javelins (one heavy  and one light), a short sword, a dagger, a pair of heavy sandals , a sarcina (marching pack), about 14 days' worth of food, a waterskin, cooking equipment, two stakes for the construction of  stake walls, or palisades, and a shovel or wicker basket.</p>
		<p>Legionaries were very disciplined—they marched 20 miles a day carrying heavy equipment, and then had to set up camp at night!</p>

	<div id="salaryExpectations">
		<p>The base wage for a soldier in ancient Rome was too low to live on. However, soldiers also received 4 payments, called “donatives”, over the course of the year, which were each greater than the base wage.  Soldiers also received an annual subsidy for grain purchases, called an “annona”. The common Roman soldier sought to eventually become a Praetorian Guard, a special unit that guarded the emperor and earned approximately 3 times the base pay of a common Roman soldier.</p>
		<p>In 301 AD, the average Roman soldier’s base wage was approximately 1800 denarii per year, each donative was roughly 2500 denarii per year, and the annual annona was worth about 600 denarii per year. However, they also had to pay for boots (100 denarii), shoes (75 denarii), and a saddle (500 denarii).</p>
		<p>To get a better sense of the denarii’s purchasing power, 8 liters of oats would have cost 30 denarii, and a pound of beef would have cost 8 denarii.</p>

		<p>Soldiers received an annual grain subsidy, worth approximately 600 denarii per year, and 4 payments that were each worth about 2500 denarii. After 25 years of service, soldiers also received their choice of land, or 3000 denarii.</p>
		<p>Weapons instructors were so important that they received double rations, while poor soldiers received inferior rations until they had proven their worth.</p>
		<p>In the war-like state Rome was, the highest civilian officers were also the military chiefs of staff and the commanding generals in battle. They answered only to the senate.</p>

	<div id="education">
		<p>Roman legionaries were first taught to march, and to march quickly! During the summer, soldiers were expected to march 20 miles in 5 hours as part of their basic training. A disjointed army with stragglers was vulnerable to attack, and the Roman’s wanted to avoid this at all costs. Soldiers were also required to run, swim, and carry heavy packs.</p>
		<p>After basic conditioning, soldiers were trained to use weapons. They used wicker shields and wooden swords, which were each twice as heavy as regular weapons, so that they would be twice as effective in combat (just like a batting donut). First the soldiers trained on heavy wooden stakes, and then on each other. In the more advanced stage of training, called armatura, the weapons were of similar weight to the original ones. Finally, soldiers were trained to master the spear (called a pilum) which, in practice, was also twice as heavy as the original.</p>

		<p><b>Discipline</b>: Soldiers were held to very high standards. For example, the punishment for repeated cowardice in battle was decimation. The cohort (a group of about 480 soldiers) selected for decimation would be split into groups of 10, and then 1 member of the group was selected at random and beaten to death by the other 9. That’s where the word decimation comes from!</p>
		<p><b>Teamwork and level-headedness</b>: Unlike opponents such as the Gauls, who were fierce individual warriors, Roman military training concentrated on instilling teamwork and maintaining a level head over individual bravery - troops were to maintain exact formations in battle and "despise wild swinging blows" in favor of sheltering behind one's shield and delivering efficient stabs when an opponent made himself vulnerable.</p>
		<p><b>Loyalty</b>: Soldiers were loyal to Rome but proud of their own unit. The most successful units received honorable recognition. For example, the 20th legion became the XX Valeria Victrix (“The Valiant and Victorious 20th”).</p>
