		<p>Ancient Egyptian civilization was successful in large part because the Egyptians were able to farm fertile soil around the Nile, the longest river in the World. During early summer months, the water level of the Nile would rise and cause the surrounding land in Egypt to flood. This period was called inundation. During the flooding months, farmers were not busy and often called upon to work for the government. </p>
		<p>As the flood began to recede in October, Egyptians would plow the now fertile soil by hand or using oxen. Then, seeds were sown into the newly plowed soil and animals trod over the seeds to push them into the ground. Crops grown included barley, wheat, flax, onions, leeks, garlic, lettuce, lentils, turnips, figs and grapes. This period was referred to as the growing season, or Peret.</p>
		<p>In February or March, the crops were harvested. Farmers also raised cattle and sheep for their meat and milk. All in all, farming in ancient Egypt was a dirty, rough and difficult job.</p>

	<div id="salaryExpectations">
		<p>Farmers were overworked and underpaid! They had to rent the farm land from the state, and then pay one third of their harvest to the land owner as rent. They also had to pay high taxes, which left them with very little. They could eat or trade what little produce they had left. Finally, if the farmers did not reach a required quota, they were beaten.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="benefits">
		<p>There were no real advantages to being an Egyptian farmer. However, because the Nile flooded regularly and the land around it was relatively fertile, they were a lot better off than farmers from other ancient civilizations.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="education">
		<p>No formal education was required to become an Egyptian farmer. Farming skills were often passed down from father to son. For example, new farmers would have been taught how to use: the hoes, ploughs, sickles, and axes. </p>

		<p><b>Physical Toughness</b>: Children became farmers when they were about 5 and worked hard for the rest of their life. Farmers were required to wake up early and work the land all day during the growing and harvesting season. They were however, granted a respite during the flooding season.</p>
